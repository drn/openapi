title: "Integration Modes"
description: 'Opkit supports two different integration modes: "pull" (via our API) and "push" (via webhooks).'

<Note>
  It's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each
  integration mode in order to determine which is appropriate for your use-case.
</Note>

The API is easier to get started with and will probably require less engineering work overall. On the other hand, webhooks are much more powerful; they ensure your application receives data as soon as it becomes available and also provide you with more fine-grained detail than is accessible through the API.

After deciding which integration mode is right for you, continue to either [API](/markdown/documentation/api) or [Webhooks](/markdown/documentation/webhooks).
